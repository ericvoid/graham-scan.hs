graham-scan.hs
==============

Graham Scan (convex hull computation) implemented in Haskell.

This implementation contains my answers to the Excercises 10, 11 and 12 of the Chapter 3 of the Real World Haskell book.

This algorithm is not quite trivial, I learned a lot writing it, and also it was enjoying. So I decided to share.

I'm having a good first impression about Haskell. It is amazing, it builds up a new mindset about computer programming.
